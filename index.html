            <h1>Hello, I’m Vivek Singh</h1>
            <p>
                – a B.Tech graduate in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Data Science.<br><br>
                My journey into analytics began with a strong academic foundation and grew through hands-on projects that bridge data with real-world decision-making.<br><br>
    
                Over time, I’ve built projects of increasing depth that strengthened my skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel. I began with the Coffee Shop Sales Analysis in Excel, a foundation-level project focusing on sales trends and customer patterns. From there, I advanced to the Amazon Sales Dashboard in Power BI, where I worked with 18K+ records to analyze shipment distribution, revenue breakdowns, and category growth, providing mid-level analytical insights. The most complex among them, the OLA Ride Prediction Dashboard, challenged me to dive deeper into KPIs and time-based ride trends, transforming raw trip data into an interactive and high-level performance monitoring solution.<br><br>
    
                One of my most comprehensive works is the Vendor Performance Analysis project, where I designed a full pipeline—from Python-based data ingestion to SQL database management and Power BI dashboards. This project automated vendor data tracking, enabling performance comparisons, shipment monitoring, and KPI reporting with a scalable structure. It reflects my ability to combine technical depth with business-driven outcomes.<br><br>
    
                Alongside these, I gained practical exposure through internships. As a Data Science Intern, I developed a Sentiment Analysis model, applying NLP techniques to classify customer opinions with measurable accuracy. Later, as a Python Developer Intern, I built a Hybrid Recommendation Engine, which applied collaborative filtering and NLP techniques to personalize user experiences. Both experiences complemented my academic and personal projects, allowing me to blend statistical understanding with hands-on development.<br><br>
    
                What drives me is the balance of clarity and impact—turning numbers into narratives that businesses can trust for growth. Guided by structured processes yet open to innovation, I approach analytics with discipline and creativity.<br><br>
    
                I am actively open to roles such as Data Analyst, Power BI Developer, SQL Developer, Business Intelligence Analyst, and Junior Data Scientist, where I can leverage my technical expertise and problem-solving mindset to deliver value through data.
