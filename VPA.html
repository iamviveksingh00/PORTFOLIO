        <p class="project-intro">
            End-to-end analysis and ETL-driven dashboard that identified vendor concentration risks, inventory carrying issues, and pricing opportunities — enabling procurement and operations teams to prioritize supplier negotiations and reduce working capital exposure...
        </p>

        <!-- Project Overview -->
        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>A mid-sized retail inventory dataset (procurement, sales, stock, and vendor master records) showed inconsistent reporting, wide variance in freight and pricing, and unclear vendor contribution to procurement dollars. The business needed a clear, data-driven view of which vendors and SKUs were driving costs, where capital was locked in unsold inventory, and whether bulk purchasing actually delivered unit-cost savings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
            <ul>
                 <p>  As the project lead, I was responsible for :</p>
                    
                 <li>  Building a reproducible ETL pipeline to consolidate and clean procurement, sales and inventory tables. </li>
                    
                 <li>  Implementing data-quality checks and reconciliation steps so KPIs were audit-ready. </li>
                    
                 <li>  Producing an interactive dashboard and a set of evidence-based recommendations to improve procurement decisions, pricing and inventory policies. </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h3>Technical & Analytical approach</h3>
                <p> <strong>1. Data ingestion & ETL</strong> </p>
                <li>Connected to the inventory SQLite database and extracted the vendor/sales view (VSS) as the canonical table.</li>
                <li>Built Python ETL scripts (Pandas + SQL) to standardize columns, handle missing/zero values, convert datatypes, and store a cleaned dataset ready for analysis.</li>

                <p> <strong>2. Data quality & validation</strong> </p>
                <li>Implemented automated validation checks (null thresholds, negative-value detection, type checks) and row-level filters to remove inconsistent transactions prior to analysis.</li>
                <li>Created reconciliation queries that compare purchase vs. sales aggregates to ensure traceability.</li>
                
                <p> <strong>3. Feature engineering & KPIs</strong> </p>
                <li>Engineered business metrics such as GrossProfit, ProfitMargin, StockTurnover, TotalPurchaseDollars, and PurchaseContribution% (per vendor).</li>
                <li>Computed vendor-level aggregates (purchase dollars, sales dollars, gross profit) for ranking and contribution analysis.</li>
                
                <p> <strong>4. Exploratory data analysis & statistics</strong> </p>
                <li>Performed summary statistics and outlier detection to identify extreme freight and price values.</li>
                <li>Ran correlation analysis to measure relationships (e.g., PurchaseQuantity vs TotalSalesQuantity) and used inferential statistics — two-sample t-tests and 95% confidence intervals — to compare profit margins across vendor cohorts.</li>
                
                <p> <strong>5. Business analysis & segmentation</strong> </p>
                <li> Segmented vendors into top-performing and low-performing groups and analyzed differences in margin, turnover and risk exposure.</li>
                <li> Measured the effect of order size on unit cost (bulk vs small orders) and identified thresholds where unit cost fell significantly.</li>
                
                <p> <strong>6. Visualization & reporting</strong> </p>
                <li>Built exploratory visualizations (scatter plots, box plots, histograms) using Matplotlib & Seaborn for the analysis notebook. </li>
                <li> Designed a production-ready Power BI dashboard with drill-downs, DAX KPIs and interactive filters to let stakeholders explore vendor contribution, unsold inventory, and pricing levers.</li>

                <p> <strong>7. Recommendations & documentation</strong> </p>
                <li>Documented recurring data issues and remediation steps (root-cause notes), and packaged findings into an executive summary and action list. </li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Key Insights from Dashboard -->
        <div class="project-section">
            <h2> Key Insights Discovered</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High variance in freight and cost:</strong> Freight values spanned a massive range (example: 0.09 → 257,032.07), indicating inconsistent logistics or occasional bulk shipment outliers that require policy standardization. </li>

                <li> <strong>Profitability anomalies:</strong> Gross profit values included negative extremes (min observed ≈ -52,002.78), suggesting pricing or discounting issues on certain SKUs.</li>
                    
                <li> <strong>Stock turnover extremes:</strong> Stock turnover ranged from 0 up to ~274.5 — showing a mix of deadstock and very fast-moving SKUs requiring differentiated inventory policies. </li>
                    
                <li> <strong>Strong procurement-sales alignment:</strong> Purchase quantity vs total sales quantity showed near-perfect aggregate correlation (~0.999) — confirming that procurement broadly follows demand, but suggesting opportunities at SKU/vendor level to improve allocation. </li>    
                    
                <li> <strong>Bulk purchasing advantage:</strong> Bulk/large orders had substantially lower unit cost — up to ~72% unit cost reduction compared with small orders — highlighting opportunities for negotiated bulk discounts and reorder point optimization. </li>
                    
                <li> <strong>Margin segmentation insight:</strong> Confidence-interval analysis revealed that low-selling vendors sometimes show higher margin intervals relative to top-sellers (e.g., top-vendor margin CI around 30.7–31.6%), indicating that high margin alone does not equal high revenue — an important nuance for procurement strategy. </li>        
             </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Result / Impact -->
        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Result / Impact</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Cost Saving Opportunities:</strong> Pinpointed vendors whose cost structures (freight + purchase price) could be renegotiated, with potential for reduced spend.</li>
                <li> <strong>Vendor Optimization:</strong> Helped highlight which vendors to prioritize vs underperformers, enabling leaner vendor management.</li>
                <li> <strong>Actionable Visibility:</strong> Dashboard enabled transparent views of vendor performance for regular review.</li>
                <li> <strong>Business Recommendations:</strong> Suggested strategies like bulk discount leverage, vendor consolidation, and optimizing inventory turnover per vendor.</li>
